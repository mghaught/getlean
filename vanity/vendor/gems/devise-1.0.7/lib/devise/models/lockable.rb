    # Handles blocking a user access after a certain number of attempts.
    # Lockable accepts two different strategies to unlock a user after it's
    # blocked: email and time. The former will send an email to the user when
    # the lock happens, containing a link to unlock it's account. The second
    # will unlock the user automatically after some configured time (ie 2.hours).
    # It's also possible to setup lockable to use both email and time strategies.
    #
    # Configuration:
    #
    #   maximum_attempts: how many attempts should be accepted before blocking the user.
    #   unlock_strategy: unlock the user account by :time, :email or :both.
    #   unlock_in: the time you want to lock the user after to lock happens. Only
    #              available when unlock_strategy is :time or :both.
