== A/B Testing With Rails (In 5 Easy Steps)

<b>Step 1:</b> Start using Vanity in your Rails application:

  Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
    gem.config "vanity"

    config.after_initialize do
      require "vanity"
    end
  end

And:

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    use_vanity :current_user
  end

<b>Step 2:</b> Define your first A/B test.  This experiment goes in the file <code>experiments/price_options.rb</code>:

  ab_test "Price options" do
    description "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the better price of all?"
    alternatives 19, 25, 29
    metrics :signups
  end

<b>Step 3:</b> Present the different options to your users:

  <h2>Get started for only $<%= ab_test :price_options %> a month!</h2>

<b>Step 4:</b> Measure conversion:

  class SignupController < ApplicationController
    def signup
      @account = Account.new(params[:account])
      if @account.save
        track! :signups
        redirect_to @acccount
      else
        render action: :offer
      end
    end
  end

<b>Step 5:</b> Check the report:

  vanity report --output vanity.html
